# Doctor Who (New Who) Chronological Viewing Order Addon for Stremio

Welcome to the most comprehensive chronological viewing order for "New Who" (2005-Present) as a Stremio addon! This addon aims to provide a seamless and story-complete viewing experience, integrating Main Show episodes, Specials, story-relevant Minisodes, and Prequels in their intended narrative order.

## Features

*   **Complete Chronological Order:** Experience the full journey of the modern Doctors, from the Ninth Doctor to the Fifteenth, and beyond.
*   **All Narrative Content Included:**
    *   **Main Show Episodes:** All regular season episodes.
    *   **Specials:** Christmas, New Year, Anniversary, and other standalone full-length special episodes.
    *   **Minisodes:** Short, story-relevant mini-episodes (e.g., Children in Need shorts, DVD extras like "Meanwhile in the TARDIS," "Night and the Doctor" series).
    *   **Prequels:** Short episodes released to directly lead into an upcoming main episode or special.
*   **Logical Season & Episode Grouping:** Episodes are grouped by season blocks, with all supplemental content (minisodes, prequels, specials) integrated sequentially within or around its relevant season.
*   **Clear Titling:** Minisodes, Prequels, and Specials are clearly identified in their titles for easy navigation.
*   **Focus on Live-Action:** This order primarily focuses on the live-action narrative content. (Note: Does not currently include animated specials like "The Infinite Quest" or "Dreamland," or purely interactive content.)

## Why This Order?

Doctor Who often releases supplemental content that enriches the main storyline, provides character development, or sets up future events. This addon ensures you don't miss these vital pieces and experience the narrative as cohesively as possible.

## Viewing Order Logic

The order is meticulously curated based on:

1.  **Broadcast Dates:** As a primary guide.
2.  **Narrative Chronology:** Where supplemental content clearly fits before or between specific episodes.
3.  **Official Releases:** Content released on DVDs/Blu-rays as extras that are narratively significant.
4.  **Prequel Intent:** Items explicitly released to set up an upcoming episode.
