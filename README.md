# 🌌 Whoniverse: Complete Doctor Who Addon for Stremio

**Your gateway to the complete New Who experience — from 2005 to 2025 and beyond!**

Hey Whovians and Stremio fans!  
I've just launched **Whoniverse**, a Doctor Who addon for Stremio that compiles the entire *New Who* era in original UK airdate order — fully enhanced for a seamless and complete viewing experience.

## 🔍 What's Included

- ✅ **All main episodes** from 2005 to 2025  
- ✅ **Specials** placed inside their respective seasons (no more scattered "Specials" tab!)  
- ✅ **Minisodes, prequels, and animated content** that are narratively relevant  
- ✅ **English subtitles** added even for content that didn’t originally have them  
- ✅ **Full, curated metadata**: thumbnails, titles, air dates, and descriptions  
- ✅ **All content hosted on archive.org**, sourced from:
  - Blu-rays  
  - BBC iPlayer  
  - Official YouTube releases  

## 🚧 What’s Not Yet Included

- ❌ *Classic Who*  
- ❌ Spin-offs like *Torchwood*, *The Sarah Jane Adventures*, or *Class*

These will be released as separate, curated series within this addon soon, each with the same level of care and organization. Stay tuned!
